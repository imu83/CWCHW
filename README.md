This repository was made for sharing homework codes between "Leads Mobile Team Meambers" 
who will be pertipating in Code Warrior Challenge 2015. we are looking forward for every one's perticipation.

The source code is very much shareable which is the opensource methodology.
Any changes/fix are welcome. please fork it and add your contribution.

This php service is hosted by xampp.

This Service Simply receive a register request(hope-fully mobile devices). 
after the request, service will save the request to database as a profile and a user information. 
And will return a json confirming the action status Success or Failed, 
if Success then returns the profile.

If there is a request for login to authentication_mobile.php then the service will verify requested 
parameters in the database and if verified then will return the users profile as json.

thats all for now... happy coding... happy sharing...
